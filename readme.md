# This is a repo to play with GIT
## Rebasing, Squashing, Branching, etc.
### Squashing multiple commits into one to push only one clean commit
#### 1- using source tree from Atlassian
#### 2- using source tree from Atlassian #2

#### add info #2
#### add info #3   second update on #3

The target is to push only one commit with all the changes to github.
how I'm doing iy is resetting the branch to first commit keeping all the local changes
